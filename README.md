### Setting up Virtual Environment (venv)

1. **Install Python**: Ensure Python is installed on your system. You can download and install Python from [Python's official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. **Create a Project Directory**: Create a directory for your project.

3. **Create Virtual Environment**: Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to create a virtual environment named 'venv':
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   ```

4. **Activate Virtual Environment**: Activate the virtual environment:
   - On Windows:
     ```
     venv\Scripts\activate
     ```
   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

5. **Install Dependencies**: With the virtual environment activated, install the required dependencies using pip:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Setting up with Docker

1. **Install Docker**: Download and install Docker Desktop from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop).

2. **Create Dockerfile**: Create a Dockerfile in the root directory of your project. Here's a sample Dockerfile for a Django project using DRF:
   ```Dockerfile
   # Use official Python image as base image
   FROM python:3.9

   # Set environment variables
   ENV PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE 1
   ENV PYTHONUNBUFFERED 1

   # Set working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # Install dependencies
   COPY requirements.txt /app/
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # Copy project files
   COPY . /app/

   # Expose port
   EXPOSE 8000

   # Command to run the application
   CMD ["python", "manage.py", "runserver", "0.0.0.0:8000"]
   ```

3. **Build Docker Image**: Open a terminal, navigate to your project directory, and run the following command to build the Docker image:
   ```
   docker build -t order-processing-system .
   ```

4. **Run Docker Container**: After successfully building the Docker image, run the Docker container using the following command:
   ```
   docker run -p 8000:8000 order-processing-system
   ```

With these steps, you've set up a virtual environment for local development and configured Docker for containerization of your Order Processing System.
